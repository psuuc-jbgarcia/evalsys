# EvalSys - IR Project Evaluation System

EvalSys is a multi-subject web-based rubric evaluation system for IT/IR project presentations. It supports Super Admin oversight, instructor-managed subjects, panel grading, structured group registration, proposal document uploads, and clean result exports.

## Key Features

- **Multi-role access**: Super Admin, Instructor, and Panel accounts.
- **Multi-subject management**: Instructors manage assigned subjects within paid subject limits.
- **Block and group management**: Create sections/blocks, register groups, and manage structured group members.
- **Structured member data**: New groups store members as last name, first name, and optional middle name. Old comma-separated/string member records remain supported.
- **Panel assignment isolation**: Panels belong to an instructor and can only be assigned within that instructor's subjects.
- **Instructor-owned rubrics**: Instructors create, edit, delete, and activate their own rubrics per subject.
- **Per-subject grading lock**: Instructors can lock grading for their own subject; Super Admin can control instructor locks.
- **Panel grading workflow**: Panels grade assigned groups, leave comments, and can view read-only mode when grading is locked.
- **Autosave and offline draft backup**: Panel scores/comments are saved locally before submission to reduce data loss.
- **Proposal upload**: Optional PDF/DOC/DOCX/PPT/PPTX proposal files are stored in Supabase Storage and opened through short-lived signed URLs.
- **Per-block exports**: Export group summary CSV or alphabetized member grades CSV for the selected block.
- **AI Insights page**: Summarizes completed group scores, strengths, weaknesses, highest group, and panel comments using local score/comment data.
- **System announcements**: Super Admin can show notices to instructors and panels.
- **Maintenance mode**: Super Admin can temporarily block instructor/panel access while updates are being applied.
- **Operations dashboard**: Audit logs, activity monitor, instructor summary, proposal storage cleanup view, and backup exports.
- **Archive support**: Submitted results are preserved when subjects are reset or when groups/blocks are deleted.
- **PWA support**: EvalSys can be installed on a device and shows an update notice when a new app build is available.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, React Router, Axios.
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Mongoose.
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas.
- **File storage**: Supabase Storage private bucket.
- **Authentication**: JWT with role-based route protection.
- **Deployment target**: Vercel frontend and Render backend.

## Backend Setup

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd back-end
   npm install
   ```

2. Create `back-end/.env`:

   ```env
   PORT=5000
   MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_long_random_secret

   SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_backend_only_secret_key
   SUPABASE_PROPOSAL_BUCKET=evalsys-proposals
   SUPABASE_STORAGE_LIMIT_MB=1024

   RENDER_API_KEY=optional_render_api_key
   RENDER_SERVICE_ID=optional_render_service_id
   ```

3. Start the backend:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

Important: never put `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` in the frontend or Vercel environment variables. It belongs only in the backend Render service.

## Frontend Setup

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd front-end
   npm install
   ```

2. Optional local `.env`:

   ```env
   VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
   ```

3. Start the frontend:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Production build:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Supabase Storage Setup

Create a private bucket:

```env
SUPABASE_PROPOSAL_BUCKET=evalsys-proposals
```

Recommended bucket settings:

- Public bucket: off
- File size limit: 10 MB
- Allowed MIME types:

```text
application/pdf,application/msword,application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document,application/vnd.ms-powerpoint,application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.presentation
```

Allowed upload types:

- PDF
- DOC
- DOCX
- PPT
- PPTX

Proposal upload is optional. Groups without proposal files still work normally.

## Main Workflows

### Super Admin

- Manage instructor subject limits.
- Lock CSV export per instructor.
- Lock grading per instructor subject.
- Assign instructors to subjects.
- Manage resources and view storage usage.
- View audit logs and activity monitor.
- Export backups.
- Review archive/legacy data.
- Publish system announcements.
- Enable/disable maintenance mode.

### Instructor

- Manage assigned subjects.
- Create sections/blocks.
- Create and edit groups.
- Import groups and panel accounts by CSV.
- Assign panels to blocks.
- Create and activate subject rubrics.
- Manage registration links.
- View results and export CSV files.
- Reset a subject for a fresh evaluation cycle.

### Panel

- View assigned blocks and groups.
- Open uploaded proposal files when available.
- Grade using the active instructor rubric.
- Add comments.
- Update submitted grades when grading is open.
- Use read-only mode when grading is locked.
- Rely on local autosave if connection is interrupted.

## Result Preservation Rules

Submitted evaluations are treated as historical records.

- Deleting a panel account keeps submitted results.
- Deleting a group archives submitted results before removing the active group.
- Deleting a block archives submitted results before removing active groups.
- Resetting a subject archives submitted results before clearing active blocks/groups.
- Deleting a subject archives submitted results before removing the subject setup.

Archived results are available to Super Admin under Archive.

## CSV Exports

When an instructor selects a block in Results, EvalSys supports:

- **Download Group Summary CSV**
- **Download Member Grades CSV**

Member grades export one row per member and sort alphabetically by:

1. Last Name
2. First Name
3. Middle Name

If a group evaluation is incomplete, the exported score is:

```text
Pending Complete Evaluation
```

## Security Notes

- Login is rate-limited.
- Accounts are temporarily locked after repeated failed login attempts.
- New accounts and reset passwords require users to change their temporary password after signing in.
- Passwords require uppercase, lowercase, number, symbol, and at least 8 characters.
- Maintenance mode blocks instructor/panel actions while allowing Super Admin access.
- Proposal files are served through backend-generated signed URLs.
- Supabase service role key must remain backend-only.

## Free-tier Hosting Notes

Render free tier may sleep after inactivity. EvalSys keeps polling conservative to avoid consuming hours too quickly.

- Announcement and maintenance status checks run every 30 seconds while the app is open.
- Socket.IO is not used by default because persistent connections can keep Render awake longer.
- PWA users receive a "New changes detected" notice when a fresh app build is available.

## Useful Commands

Backend syntax check:

```bash
cd back-end
node --check src/index.js
```

Frontend production build:

```bash
cd front-end
npm run build
```

## Current Known Follow-ups

- Replace remaining native browser `confirm()` calls with the custom EvalSys modal style.
- Add a frontend `.env.example`.
- Add a controlled cleanup action for orphaned Supabase proposal files.
- Consider frontend code splitting if the production bundle grows much larger.
